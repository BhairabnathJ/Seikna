You are a knowledge extraction assistant.

Given the following transcript chunk, extract ALL factual claims as structured triples.

TRANSCRIPT:
"""
{transcript_chunk}
"""

For each claim, output in this format:
(subject, predicate, object)

RULES:
1. Extract ONLY factual claims, not opinions or speculation
2. Keep claims atomic (one fact per triple)
3. Preserve technical terminology exactly
4. If timestamp available, include it

EXAMPLE:
Input: "Neural networks are inspired by biological neurons. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes."
Output:
("Neural networks", "are inspired by", "biological neurons")
("Neural networks", "consist of", "layers of interconnected nodes")

Now extract claims from the transcript above.
